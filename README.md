# detectcovid

This is a guided project from Coursera that I completed to develop my skills in Deep Learning using PyTorch.

### Objective:

- Train a ResNet-18 model in PyTorch that can predict Chest X-Ray scans that belong to one of the three classes (Image classification)

### Dataset:  
This dataset has nearly 3000 Chest X-Ray scans which are categorized in three classes - Normal, Viral Pneumonia and COVID-19.

The Dataset is available here: [COVID-19 Radiography Database](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database)

### Learning Outcomes:

- Understanding of transfer learning to retrain a model to classify a new set of images

- Creating Custom Dataset
- Preparing Data Loaders
- More familiarity with model training using PyTorch


#### Note:    
This model can not be used to diagnose COVID-19 or Viral Pneumonia. This project is only for educational purpose.
